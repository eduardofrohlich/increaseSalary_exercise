# What is this project?

Write a program to read an integer N and then the
data (id, name and salary) of N employees. there must not be
id repetition.

Then make the X percent increase in the salary of
a particular employee. For this, the program must read
an id and the X value. If the informed id does not exist, show
a message and abort the operation. Finally, show the
updated list of employees, as examples.

Remember to apply the encapsulation technique so as not to
allow the salary to be freely changed. One
salary can only be increased based on an operation
increase per given percentage.

# What I used in the program?
- Lists (List type)
- Operations: add element to list, access element, loop through and analyze list elements

# Example output:
```
